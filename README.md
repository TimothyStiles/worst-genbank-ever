# worst-genbank-ever

What's the hardest to parse but still technically valid genbank file possible? I don't know what it is but I know I want to see it. 

To help create something that shouldn't exist:

* [fork this repo](https://github.com/TimothyStiles/worst-genbank-ever/fork)
* add some terrible features that are still [valid genbank](https://www.insdc.org/files/feature_table.html) to `worst-genbank-ever.gbk`
* make a pull-request
* profit


With enough additions we'll have created a kafka-esque leviathan remembered by bioinformaticians for generations to come. The worst. genbank. ever.
